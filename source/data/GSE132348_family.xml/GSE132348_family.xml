      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

RNA was hybridized to capture probes and reporter probes using the NanoString nCounter system according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each reporter probe provided by the manufacturer was labeled with a propierty flourescent barcode system specific for each transcript.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Pretreatment diagnostic biopsies from ABVD-treated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma patients

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Pretreatment diagnostic biopsies from ABVD-treated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma patients

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Pretreatment diagnostic biopsies from ABVD-treated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma patients

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Pretreatment diagnostic biopsies from ABVD-treated classical Hodgkin Lymphoma patients

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples).

Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

Total RNA was hybridized to capture probes and reporter probes using the NanoString nCounter system according to the manufacturer's protocol
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor diagnostic biopsies of classical Hodgkin Lymphoma were reviewed by three different pathologists. For RNA purification, five 5um FFPE slides were cut for each tumor. Total RNA was extracted by Maxwell® RSC RNA FFPE kit (Promega). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For samples that reached the quality standards (A260/A280 ≥ 1.7 and A260/A230 ≥ 1.8), we evaluated the expression profile of 773 genes by NanoString using the PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were collected as NanoString RCC files. The data were normalized using 10 HK genes (SF3A3, PPIA, POLR2A, MRPS5, MTMR14, GUSB, G6PD, ERCC3, EIF2B4, COG7). Raw values are the number of copies of each molecular barcode representative of a specific transcript.
Mean count of negative controls plus two standard deviations was subtracted from each gene count to eliminate negative background. Then normalization on synthetic positive controls was conducted by multiplying the count of each gene for a correction factor. This factor was calculated for each sample as the ratio between the quadratic mean of positive controls counts and the mean of quadratic means in all samples. In order to performed CodeSet Content normalization on housekeeping genes, ten reference genes were selected among the forty available in the panel based on the lowest coefficients of variation (CV= ratio between mean counts and standard deviations across all samples). Finally, CodeSet Content normalization was performed by multiplying genes counts for a further correction factor calculated on reference genes as described for positive technical controls. After completion of normalization processes, counts were log2 transformed.
